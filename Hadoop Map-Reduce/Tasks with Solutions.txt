Objectives

1. Run a single-node Hadoop instance
2. Perform a word count using Hadoop Map Reduce.

Exercise: 

Set up Single-Node Hadoop:
The steps outlined in this lab use the single-node Hadoop Version 3.2.3. Hadoop is most useful when deployed in a fully distributed mode on a large cluster of networked servers sharing a large volume of data. However, for basic understanding, we will configure Hadoop on a single node.

	1. Start a new terminal
	2. Download hadoop-3.2.3.tar.gz to your theia environment by running the following command.
		--> curl https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.2.3/hadoop-3.2.3.tar.gz --output hadoop-3.2.3.tar.gz
	3. Extract the tar file in the currently directory.
		--> tar -xvf hadoop-3.2.3.tar.gz
	4. Navigate to the hadoop-3.2.3 directory.
		--> cd hadoop-3.2.3
	5. Check the hadoop command to see if it is setup. This will display the usage documentation for the hadoop script.
		--> bin/hadoop
	6. Run the following command to download data.txt to your current directory.
		--> curl https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-BD0225EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/data/data.txt --output data.txt
	7. Run the Map reduce application for wordcount on data.txt and store the output in /user/root/output
		--> bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.2.3.jar wordcount data.txt output
	8. Once the word count runs successfully, you can run the following command to see the output file it has generated.
		--> ls output
	9. Run the following command to see the word count output.
		--> cat  output/part-r-00000
